# Pydrogen

That [one SciBorgs' repository](https://github.com/SciBorgs/Hydrogen), except it's been ported to Python!

**CURRENTLY WIP**

This could (in theory) one day be used on an actual swerve chassis, but is currently **being worked on**. Theoretically, this *should* be done by the end of August, but we'll see. The idea is that I could revisit all the files in the original Hydrogen, while also learning `robotpy` and creating something useful for some python teams. And also maybe figuring out how to help any python teams in real life out there?
