# Pydrogen

**CURRENTLY WIP**

This could (in theory) one day be used on an actual swerve chassis, but is currently **being worked on**. Theoretically, this *should* be done by the end of August (spoilers, it was not), but we'll see. The idea is that I could revisit all the files in the original Hydrogen, while also learning `robotpy` and creating something useful for some python teams. And also maybe figuring out how to help any python teams in real life out there?

**(i do not actually intend on actually switching to python (python for FRC is just really unsupported by a lot of vendors as of now), but i just thought of the pun and found it funny)**

That [one SciBorgs' repository](https://github.com/SciBorgs/Hydrogen), except it's been ported to Python!

Pydrogen attempts to stay very loyal to the code structure on Hydrogen (from docs to imports!) and contains a link to the original Hydrogen file from GitHub. If something mysterious is occuring in a file, try checking the original Java file, as mistakes could be present while converting it! Additionally, this means that types are specified (ex. return types), similarly to Java! This should also make it easier for any future maintenance of Pydrogen for any future Hydrogen updates.
